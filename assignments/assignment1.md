**Domains**
**Ten domains:**
1. Training for Sports (Basketball)
2. Exploring Campus Life
**3. Making Food**
**4. Finance budgeting**
4. Studying for tests
**6. Focusing for school/work (like Forest app)**
7. Scheduling/calendar (school, work)
8. Learning languages
9. Booking flights
10. Choosing clothes

**3 Selected Domains:**
3. Making Food: It takes a lot of time to make our own food, so we opt to eat out more often than we should. Deciding what you want to eat to buying ingredients to the final step of cooking takes a lot of time personally for me, so I have never consistently cooked for myself, but I'll be forced to. After college, I will either have to eat out, spending more money, or cook my own meals, which is healthier and cheaper to do. 
4. Finance budgeting: I don't precisely keep track of my spending, so when I look back at it, at the end of the month or year, I have little to no idea where most of my money went towards. 
6. Focusing for school/work: I still struggle with procastination and don't get as much done or do as well on assignments as I could or want to do. Often, after working a few hours I will treat myself with a "little break" and end up wasting hours that could've been spent working productively.
