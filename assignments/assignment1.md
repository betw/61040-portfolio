# Assignment 1: Problem Selection

## Domains

## Ten domains of interest:##

1.  Training for Sports (Basketball)
2.  Exploring Campus Life
3.  Making Food
4.  Managing Finances
5.  Studying for Tests
6.  Focusing for School/Work
7.  Scheduling/Calendar (school, work)
8.  Learning Languages
9.  Booking Flights
10. Choosing Clothes

## Selected Domains

**Three domains were chosen for further exploration:**

### üçî **Making Food**
Making my own food is time-consuming, which often leads to eating out more than I should. This is a problem I'll face after college when I'll be forced to choose between the cost of eating out and the effort of cooking, with the latter being both healthier and cheaper.

### üí∞ **Managing Finances**
I lack precise spending tracking, which makes it difficult to understand where my money goes at the end of the month or year. This problem highlights a need for better visibility into my financial habits.

### üéØ **Focusing for School/Work**
I struggle with procrastination and productivity. My habit of taking a "little break" after working often results in hours of wasted time, preventing me from completing assignments as well or as efficiently as I could.

## Problems within Domains

**Each of the three selected domains was broken down into a set of 3 problems:**

### üçî **Making Food**
1.  Deciding what meals to eat
2.  Finding ingredients for a meal
3.  Shopping for ingredients

### üí∞ **Managing Finances**
1.  Finding good credit/investment accounts
2.  Setting monthly budgets
3.  Tracking savings for discretionary expenses

### üéØ **Focusing for School/Work**
1.  Not knowing exactly how much time I spent doing or not doing work
2.  Ease of distraction (phone, new tab in Chrome)
3.  Allocating time for different assignments across multiple days

## Final Problem Selection

**From the list of nine, three specific problems were selected and refined based on their potential for a viable solution:**

| Problem | Rationale for Exclusion (if applicable) | Rationale for Inclusion (if applicable) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Deciding what meals to eat** | Requires hyper-personalization to a user‚Äôs tastes and struggles to differentiate from established services like UberEats or Grubhub. | |
| **2. Finding ingredients for meals** | Not much differentiation is possible as many recipe websites already solve this. | |
| **3. Shopping for ingredients** | Users quickly learn local store layouts. Additionally, store pickup can result in poor ingredient quality, encouraging in-person shopping anyway. | |
| **4. Finding good credit/investment accounts** | | While many online lists exist, the process is mundane and laborious for users. A tool could provide a better, less labor-intensive solution. |
| **5. Setting monthly budgets** | It is difficult to differentiate from other apps, and many users may dislike the restrictive nature of budgeting. | |
| **6. Tracking saving for discretionary expenses** | | While some people may use financial advisors for this, a cheaper, more accessible tool could provide significant value, especially for smaller, discretionary goals. |
| **7. Not knowing exactly how much time I spent in a day doing or not doing work** | | The core issue lies in the lack of a seamless tracking system. A solution could provide a clear picture of time allocation and increase productivity. |
| **8. Ease of distraction** | Many users can solve this by changing their environment (e.g., studying in a library). Creating a seamless cross-device solution is technically complex. | |
| **9. Allocating time for different assignments across multiple days** | Requires significant hyper-personalization and context to work effectively, making a general automated fix difficult to implement with significant value. | |
