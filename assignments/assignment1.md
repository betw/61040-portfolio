# Assignment 1
**Domains**
**Ten domains:**
1. Training for Sports (Basketball)
2. Exploring Campus Life
**3. Making Food**
**4. Managing Finances**
4. Studying for tests
**6. Focusing for school/work (like Forest app)**
7. Scheduling/calendar (school, work)
8. Learning languages
9. Booking flights
10. Choosing clothes

**3 Selected Domains:**
3. Making Food: It takes a lot of time to make our own food, so we opt to eat out more often than we should. Deciding what you want to eat to buying ingredients to the final step of cooking takes a lot of time personally for me, so I have never consistently cooked for myself, but I'll be forced to. After college, I will either have to eat out, spending more money, or cook my own meals, which is healthier and cheaper to do. 
4. Managing Finances: I don't precisely keep track of my spending, so when I look back at it, at the end of the month or year, I have little to no idea specifically where most of my money went towards. 
6. Focusing for school/work: I still struggle with procastination and don't get as much done or do as well on assignments as I could or want to do. Often, after working a few hours I will treat myself with a "little break" and end up wasting hours that could've been spent working productively.

**Problems**
**Selected domains to 3 problems:**
3. Making Food:
  1. Deciding what meals to eat
  2. Finding ingredients for a meal
  3. Shooping for ingredients
4. Managing Finances:
   1. Finding good credit/investment accounts
   2. Setting monthly budgets
   3. Tracking savings for discretionary expenses
6. Focusing for school/work:
   1. Not knowing exactly how much time I spent in a day doing or not doing work
   2. Ease of distraction (phone, new tab in chrome)
   3. Allocating time for different assignments across multiple days
**Nine problems to Three**:
   1. Deciding what meals to eat: Requires hyper-personalization to understand a user's tastes and it's difficult to differentiate any app for this problem from UberEats, Grubhub and others which have critical mass and loyal customers.
   2. Finding ingredients for meals: not much differentiation possible, many recipe websites
   3. Shopping for ingredients: easily find cheapest ingredients in-store, not much differentiation from CookList, Afer a while people know where to find ingredients at their local store, store pickup workers select don't select the freshest food so person has to go in-person anyways
  ** 4. Finding good credit/investment accounts:** many online lists people peruse to find accounts they want, but mundane, laboroious to do
   5. Setting monthly budgets: hard to differentiate from many other apps offering this; People might hate limiting their spending; 
 **  6. Tracking saving for discretionary expenses: **For those who have enough to save for retirement/school/vacation they will rather have a trained financial adivsor or tools available at their banks to help them but if the fix for this is much cheaper and still provides value for them they will use it
**   7. Not knowing exactly how much time I spent in a day doing or not doing work:** People might dislike how much needs to be known to track this seamlessly,
   8. (x) Ease of distraction (phone, new tab in chrome): People might be indifferent to this problem as they can work in libraries or other "study" areas where the environment keeps you focused, requires complex communication between devices to minimize distractions
   9. (x) Allocating time for different assignments across multiple days: This also requires hyper-personalization since it requires significant context to understand how long some assignment should take. Additionally, people might be indifferent to this as a automatated fix for only this particular problem would not provide much value to users.
**Three Selected Problems:**
   Best account for me
   4. Finding good bank/investment accounts: People including me struggle to find a good bank/investment account that best fits my preferences, from wanting access to financial advisors, to wanting brick-and-mortar based institutions or not. Many tools that try to solve this problem require your SSN number. While that offers more personalization, it also isn't in the user's interest to do that, as the company collecting that data could seel it (probably not the SSN but what cards you viewed, etc..). Fewer tools don't require a SSN number but require a set number of preferences a user must tell them about. My solution could allow users to skip some preferences and have a larger set of preferences to set, such as lower interest rates, minimal fees, etc...
   Piggy bank
   6. Tracking saving for discretionary expenses: People including me don't usually think and act in terms of the medium-to-long term, so saving for that vacation, suit, or car is difficult and time-consuming. While there are apps that allow you to track savings for discretionary expenses such as Qapital, those apps offer many more features that this possibly useful solution might not be used as much, so I'll streamline the solution to specifically solve this problem. Additionally, Qapital has you set a target amount for a goal but I would offer an estimate which the user can change or keep.
   Track a good day's work
   8. Not knowing work/no work hours in a day: I sometimes don't understand why I don't get as much work done as I want to. Whether it's my speed or how long I've been working or not, I seldom know. I suspect many others might have the same problem and the upside to providing a clearer picture to me and others would either convict us into spending less time on social media or speed up our work, and lessen the shame that comes with feeling like you've not been productive.
