**Three Selected Problems:**
   Best account for me
   1. Finding good bank/investment accounts: People including me struggle to find a good bank/investment account that best fits my preferences, from wanting access to financial advisors, to wanting brick-and-mortar based institutions or not. Many tools that try to solve this problem require your SSN number. While that offers more personalization, it also isn't in the user's interest to do that, as the company collecting that data could seel it (probably not the SSN but what cards you viewed, etc..). Fewer tools don't require a SSN number but require a set number of preferences a user must tell them about. My solution could allow users to skip some preferences and have a larger set of preferences to set, such as lower interest rates, minimal fees, etc...
   Piggy bank
   3. Tracking saving for discretionary expenses: People including me don't usually think and act in terms of the medium-to-long term, so saving for that vacation, suit, or car is difficult and time-consuming. While there are apps that allow you to track savings for discretionary expenses such as Qapital, those apps offer so many features that this possibly useful solution gets buried, so I'll streamline the solution to specifically solve this problem. Additionally, Qapital has you set a target amount for a goal but I would offer an estimate which the user can change or keep.
   Track a good day's work
   4. Not knowing work/no work hours in a day: I sometimes don't understand why I don't get as much work done as I want to. Whether it's my speed or how long I've been working or not, I seldom know. I suspect many others might have the same problem and the upside to providing a clearer picture to me and others would either convict us into spending less time on social media or speed up our work, and lessen the shame that comes with feeling like you've not been productive.
**Stakeholders:** (AI-assisted generation)
Finding a Good Bank/Investment Account
Direct Users: People looking for a new bank or investment account. This includes individuals who are unsatisfied with their current financial institution, those new to banking or investing, and people with specific needs like access to financial advisors or brick-and-mortar locations.

Financial Institutions: Financial institutions have a stake, as they want to attract new customers and may be interested in a tool that helps them do so more efficiently, or they might discourage the use of such tools because their name doesn't appear as often in search results.

Privacy Advocates & Regulators: Groups and government bodies concerned with data privacy and consumer protection. They are stakeholders because a tool that collects sensitive financial information, even without an SSN, needs to be transparent about its data practices and adhere to regulations to ensure user information is protected.

Piggy Bank (Tracking Savings for Discretionary Expenses)
Direct Users: Individuals who struggle with saving for specific, non-essential goals like vacations or expensive purchases. This group includes young adults, families saving for a trip, or anyone who finds short to medium-term financial planning challenging.

Fintech Companies & Banks: Financial technology companies and traditional banks with existing savings features (like Qapital) are stakeholders. They will be interested in this new, streamlined approach as it could either be a competitor or a potential partner for integration.

Retailers & Travel Companies: Businesses that sell the very items users are saving for. For example, a travel agency or a clothing retailer could partner with this tool to offer incentives or promotions to users who have reached a certain savings milestone. They have a vested interest in helping consumers reach their saving goals so they can make a purchase.

Track a Good Day's Work
Direct Users: Individuals who feel unproductive and want to understand how they spend their time during the workday. This includes freelancers, students, remote employees, and anyone looking to improve their time management and productivity.

Employers & Team Managers: Businesses and managers who want to help their employees be more productive and manage their time effectively. They could use an aggregated, anonymized version of the data to understand common time sinks within their organization or recommend the tool to their teams as a way to boost efficiency and morale.

Psychologists & Mental Health Professionals: Experts in productivity, time management, and mental wellness. They are stakeholders because this tool addresses feelings of shame and lack of control related to work. They could use insights from the app to better understand productivity-related anxiety and offer targeted advice or therapies.

Finding a Good Bank/Investment Account** | **The "Underbanked" Population:** [1](https://www.fdic.gov/household-survey) | 19 million U.S. households, or 14.2%, are underbanked, indicating that their current banking solutions are insufficient and they are likely seeking better options that fit their specific needs. |
| | **Overwhelming Choice:** [1](https://www.fdic.gov/bank/statistical/stats/2023dec/all.html) | The existence of over 4,000 banks and thousands of credit unions creates a confusing landscape, making it hard for individuals to effectively compare and select an account. |

| | **High-Yield Savings Disconnect:** [3](https://www.lendingclub.com/blog/2024-lendingclub-saving-survey) | The low adoption rate of high-yield savings accounts (34% of adults) suggests many are unaware of or have difficulty accessing these beneficial products. |
| | **The "Sticky" Customer Problem:** [4](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2023-us-retail-banking-satisfaction-study) | The high rate of consumer inertia demonstrates that the process of switching banks is perceived as too much of a hassle, highlighting the need for a simplified solution. |

| | **Desire for Human Interaction vs. Digital-Only:** [6](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/financial-services/articles/future-of-banking-digital-engagement.html) | The persistent consumer demand for in-person services and financial advisors indicates that a fully digital solution won't work for everyone, and filtering for these preferences is crucial. |
| | **The Rise of Fintech and Niche Players:** [7](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/the-future-of-us-banking) | The fragmentation of financial services across many specialized fintechs makes it harder for consumers to find a single, comprehensive solution that meets all their needs. |
| | **NerdWallet & Bankrate:** [8](https://www.nerdwallet.com) | These comparable sites offer broad lists but lack the personalization needed for a user to find a holistic fit, as they often rely on static rankings and reviews. |
| | **Robo-Advisors & Investment Platforms:** [3](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/investing/robo-advisors) | While personalized for investing, these platforms are not designed for general banking needs and require significant data input, failing to serve users who want a broader solution. |

3. Piggy Bank (Tracking Savings for Discretionary Expenses)
Saving is a Challenge: A 2025 NerdWallet survey found that while 90% of Americans set financial goals for the year, nearly half (45%) were not on track to meet their biggest goal. This highlights the widespread difficulty people have in following through on their saving intentions. 4

Generational Shift in Priorities: Millennials, in particular, place a high value on experiences like travel. A 2025 Investopedia study found that 75% of millennials rank yearly travel as a priority, compared to 64% of baby boomers. This shows a strong cultural drive to save for discretionary experiences, making this a highly relevant problem for a large user base. 5

Comparables and their Limitations
Qapital: This app allows users to create savings goals and automate savings based on "rules" like rounding up purchases. However, Qapital has so many features that this possibly useful solution gets buried among them.

General Budgeting Apps (e.g., YNAB, Monarch Money): These apps are designed to help users track and manage their entire budget, including setting aside money for savings goals. These tools often require a high level of manual upkeep and commitment. As noted in a NerdWallet review, "you have to be committed to keep up with YNAB." This can be a significant barrier for users who struggle with long-term planning and may want a more passive or streamlined solution. 6

4. Track a Good Day's Work
Low Perceived Productivity: A 2025 study cited by Lifehack Method found that the average employee is productive for just 2 hours and 53 minutes each day. This statistic powerfully illustrates the widespread feeling of not getting enough work done. 7

Lack of a System: The same study revealed that 82% of people don't have a time management system in place. This indicates a massive potential user base that is actively seeking a solution to this problem, but hasn't found one that works for them. 7

Comparables and their Limitations
Time Tracking Apps (e.g., My Hours, Timely): These are designed for professional use, often for billing clients or managing teams. They allow users to log hours spent on specific tasks. They are often too complex and focused on business needs rather than personal productivity. They can be expensive and may require a lot of manual input, which discourages individual use. 8

Pomodoro Timers: Apps and websites that use the Pomodoro Technique, which breaks work into timed intervals. These apps don't offer the holistic view of a user's day that the problem describes. They only track "on" time but don't provide a bigger picture of how that time is being spent or identify specific productivity sinks like social media or distractions, which are key to solving the user's problem.
