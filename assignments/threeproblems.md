**Three Selected Problems:**
   Best account for me
   1. Finding good bank/investment accounts: People including me struggle to find a good bank/investment account that best fits my preferences, from wanting access to financial advisors, to wanting brick-and-mortar based institutions or not. Many tools that try to solve this problem require your SSN number. While that offers more personalization, it also isn't in the user's interest to do that, as the company collecting that data could seel it (probably not the SSN but what cards you viewed, etc..). Fewer tools don't require a SSN number but require a set number of preferences a user must tell them about. My solution could allow users to skip some preferences and have a larger set of preferences to set, such as lower interest rates, minimal fees, etc...
   Piggy bank
   3. Tracking saving for discretionary expenses: People including me don't usually think and act in terms of the medium-to-long term, so saving for that vacation, suit, or car is difficult and time-consuming. While there are apps that allow you to track savings for discretionary expenses such as Qapital, those apps offer so many features that this possibly useful solution gets buried, so I'll streamline the solution to specifically solve this problem. Additionally, Qapital has you set a target amount for a goal but I would offer an estimate which the user can change or keep.
   Track a good day's work
   4. Not knowing work/no work hours in a day: I sometimes don't understand why I don't get as much work done as I want to. Whether it's my speed or how long I've been working or not, I seldom know. I suspect many others might have the same problem and the upside to providing a clearer picture to me and others would either convict us into spending less time on social media or speed up our work, and lessen the shame that comes with feeling like you've not been productive.
**Stakeholders:** (AI-assisted generation)
Finding a Good Bank/Investment Account
Direct Users: People looking for a new bank or investment account. This includes individuals who are unsatisfied with their current financial institution, those new to banking or investing, and people with specific needs like access to financial advisors or brick-and-mortar locations.

Financial Institutions: Financial institutions have a stake, as they want to attract new customers and may be interested in a tool that helps them do so more efficiently, or they might discourage the use of such tools because their name doesn't appear as often in search results.

Privacy Advocates & Regulators: Groups and government bodies concerned with data privacy and consumer protection. They are stakeholders because a tool that collects sensitive financial information, even without an SSN, needs to be transparent about its data practices and adhere to regulations to ensure user information is protected.

Piggy Bank (Tracking Savings for Discretionary Expenses)
Direct Users: Individuals who struggle with saving for specific, non-essential goals like vacations or expensive purchases. This group includes young adults, families saving for a trip, or anyone who finds short to medium-term financial planning challenging.

Fintech Companies & Banks: Financial technology companies and traditional banks with existing savings features (like Qapital) are stakeholders. They will be interested in this new, streamlined approach as it could either be a competitor or a potential partner for integration.

Retailers & Travel Companies: Businesses that sell the very items users are saving for. For example, a travel agency or a clothing retailer could partner with this tool to offer incentives or promotions to users who have reached a certain savings milestone. They have a vested interest in helping consumers reach their saving goals so they can make a purchase.

Track a Good Day's Work
Direct Users: Individuals who feel unproductive and want to understand how they spend their time during the workday. This includes freelancers, students, remote employees, and anyone looking to improve their time management and productivity.

Employers & Team Managers: Businesses and managers who want to help their employees be more productive and manage their time effectively. They could use an aggregated, anonymized version of the data to understand common time sinks within their organization or recommend the tool to their teams as a way to boost efficiency and morale.

Psychologists & Mental Health Professionals: Experts in productivity, time management, and mental wellness. They are stakeholders because this tool addresses feelings of shame and lack of control related to work. They could use insights from the app to better understand productivity-related anxiety and offer targeted advice or therapies.
