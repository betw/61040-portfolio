| Problem | Feature | What it Does | Why it Addresses the Problem |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Best Account for Me** | **1. Preference Selection/Non-selection** | Allows users to specify their preferences (e.g., low fees, high interest, brick-and-mortar access) but also lets them skip any they don't want to provide. | It gives users control over their data, which addresses privacy concerns and overcomes the hurdle of being forced to provide too much information. This builds trust and encourages user adoption. |
| | **2. Top 3 Matches Comparison** | Presents a simplified, side-by-side comparison of the top three best-fitting accounts based on a user's preferences, rather than a long list. | It reduces decision fatigue and helps the user quickly and confidently choose an account, making the complex process of finding a bank or investment account much more manageable. |
| | **3. Notification for New Services** | Alerts users to new financial products or promotions that match their previously set preferences. | It keeps users informed about a constantly changing market without requiring them to do the tedious work of constant searching, ensuring they don't miss out on better options. |
| **Piggy Bank** | **1. Automated Cost Estimation** | Provides an estimated cost for a discretionary goal (like a vacation) and recommends a weekly or monthly savings amount to reach it. | This feature tackles the common problem of not knowing where to start saving, providing a clear, actionable plan that makes a long-term goal feel less daunting and more achievable. |
| | **2. Color-coded Vacation Map** | Visualizes average vacation costs on a map, with regions color-coded by expense level. | It makes the abstract goal of saving for travel more tangible and concrete, helping users visualize their goal and stay motivated by seeing the cost in a geographical context.  |
| | **3. Badge Reward System** | Awards digital badges or other virtual rewards when users hit specific savings milestones. | By gamifying the process, it provides positive reinforcement and makes saving a rewarding experience, helping to sustain motivation over the long term. |
| **Track a Good Day's Work** | **1. Data Visualization of Work Habits** | Automatically tracks and displays a visual breakdown of time spent on work-related tasks versus distractions. | It provides an objective, clearer picture of a person's work/no work hours, which helps users understand their habits and identify time-wasting behaviors. |
| | **2. Group Productivity Sharing** | Enables users to share their productivity statistics with friends or colleagues in private groups. | It leverages social accountability to encourage users to stay on task and can foster a sense of community and friendly competition. |
| | **3. Personalized Reward Recommendations** | Based on a user's productivity data, the app suggests a personalized reward for a good day's or week's work. | This feature creates a positive feedback loop, linking productive behavior to a tangible reward and helping to lessen the feelings of shame associated with low productivity. |
