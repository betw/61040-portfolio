# Problem Domain: Managing Finances


### ðŸ’° **Managing Finances**
I lack precise tracking of my spending, which makes it difficult to understand where my money goes at the end of the month or year and makes it difficult to save for small or large expenses. This problem highlights a need for better visibility into my financial habits. I want to have an easier time tracking my spending and savings so I can go on trips wiht friends or buy electronics, or other consumer items that people can't just buy on the fly.

### Tracking savings for discretionary expenses

| Problem | Stakeholders | How the Stakeholder is Related to the Problem |
|---|---|---|
| **Piggy Bank** | **Direct Users** | Individuals who struggle with saving for discretionary goals are the core users. They need a simple, intuitive tool to help them overcome behavioral challenges and consistently set aside money for things they want, like a vacation or a new suit. |
| | **Fintech Companies & Banks** | Existing financial institutions and technology companies with savings features (like Qapital) are directly impacted. They may see this solution as a threat to their user base or a potential opportunity for partnership or acquisition to enhance their own offerings. |
| | **Retailers & Travel Companies** | Businesses that sell the products or services people are saving for (e.g., travel agencies, clothing stores) have a direct interest in seeing their target customers reach their savings goals. They could use this tool to offer targeted promotions or a seamless purchasing experience. |
