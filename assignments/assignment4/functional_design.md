# Problem Domain: Managing Finances


### Domain:ðŸ’° **Managing Finances**
I lack precise tracking of my spending, which makes it difficult to understand where my money goes at the end of the month or year and makes it difficult to save for small or large expenses. This problem highlights a need for better visibility into my financial habits. I want to have an easier time tracking my spending and savings so I can go on trips wiht friends or buy electronics, or other consumer items that most people can't just buy on the fly.

### Problem: Tracking savings for discretionary expenses
Betweeen paying the bills and saving for large expenses, saving for discretionary expenses is often forgotten about. Either people splurge and potentially regret it later or they avoid discretionary expenses altogether. For instance, if an average person wants to go on a vacation, they devote a large part of a few paychecks to afford it, or they decide to forgo taking the trip.
