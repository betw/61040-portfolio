| **Best Account for Me** | **Direct Users** | These are the individuals actively seeking a financial solution that fits their specific needs. They are the primary beneficiaries of a tool that can help them navigate the complex landscape of banking and investment accounts without compromising their personal data. |
| | **Financial Institutions** | Banks and investment firms have a vested interest in attracting new customers. A tool that helps users find the "best" account for them could be a powerful marketing channel, or a competitor if it highlights their shortcomings. They are also concerned with the data privacy implications of such a service. |

| | **Fintech Companies & Banks** | Existing financial institutions and technology companies with savings features (like Qapital) are directly impacted. They may see this solution as a threat to their user base or a potential opportunity for partnership or acquisition to enhance their own offerings. |

They could use this tool to offer targeted promotions or a seamless purchasing experience. |
| **Track a Good Day's Work** | **Direct Users** | These are the people who feel unproductive and want to understand their work habits. This includes freelancers, students, and remote workers who want to improve their time management, reduce feelings of shame, and boost their overall efficiency. |
| | **Employers & Team Managers** | Businesses are stakeholders because employee productivity directly impacts their bottom line. They could use an anonymized version of the data to identify systemic issues, or recommend the tool to their employees to improve performance and well-being. |
| | **Psychologists & Mental Health Professionals** | Experts in mental health are related to this problem as it addresses feelings of anxiety and shame connected to productivity. The data and insights from this tool could be valuable for understanding and treating work-related stress, procrastination, and digital burnout. |
